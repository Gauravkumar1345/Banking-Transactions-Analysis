# 🏦 Banking Transactions Analysis – Data Analyst Project

## 📌 Project Summary

This is an end-to-end Data Analyst portfolio project where banking transaction data is analyzed to understand customer spending behavior, financial activity patterns, and potential risk indicators.

The project demonstrates practical use of **SQL, Python, and Power BI** in a real-world analytics workflow starting from raw data to business insights and dashboard reporting.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze customer transaction behavior
* Identify high-value and frequent transactions
* Detect risky customers based on credit score and spending
* Understand monthly and channel-wise transaction trends
* Create an interactive dashboard for business decision making

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL (MySQL)** → Data querying & aggregation
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** → Data cleaning & exploratory analysis
* **Power BI** → Dashboard & visualization
* **CSV Dataset** → Source data

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains **1000 banking transactions** with customer and transaction details including:

* Customer ID
* Transaction type (Debit/Credit)
* Transaction amount
* Transaction date
* Merchant category
* Transaction channel
* Credit score
* Annual income
* City and employment type

## 🔎 Analysis Performed

### SQL Analysis

* Total number of transactions
* Unique customers
* Debit vs Credit comparison
* Monthly transaction trends
* Top spending customers
* High-value transactions
* City-wise and employment-wise spending

### Python (EDA)

* Data inspection and preprocessing
* Transaction amount distribution
* Spending pattern visualization
* Customer behavior analysis
* Risk customer identification

### Power BI Dashboard

The interactive dashboard provides:

* Monthly transaction overview
* Transaction channel usage
* Top customers by spending
* City-wise spending comparison
* Credit risk indicators

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Debit transactions dominate over credit transactions
* Customers with lower credit scores show higher financial risk
* Certain cities contribute significantly to total transaction volume
* High-value transactions (>15,000) are limited but impactful
* Spending behavior varies across employment types
